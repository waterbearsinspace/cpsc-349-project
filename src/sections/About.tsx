            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I began my journey into programming and computer science proper in around 2022, though I had a bit of experience trying to learn how to make a game once years before that and have even copied html into my myspace page further back than that. I've always been interested in computers and technology but never considered a career in the field until relatively recently, though I've made my way now to being fortunate enough to have an internship at a software solutions company.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I switched from slowly making my way through pre-nursing when I was applying for a private school and saw how much tuition was. When I considered if nursing was actually something I wanted to do, I decided handily that it wasn't and proceeded to look into computer science. I took classes at my local community college to earn my Associate's Degree for Transfer and will be finishing my final semester at California State University Fullerton. </p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I primarily develop web applications, using vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript/Typescript as well as React for the front end and Node.js for the back end. I also have experience programming with C++, Java, and Python, and have used SQL for database work as well.</p>
